# Databusters: The Data Science and Economics Challenge

## GitHub Repository Instructions
- The forked repository is public by default and it can't be made private. If you wish to collaborate on the project through GitHub, you can create a private repository and add your teammates as collaborators. 
- [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) is a set of instructions to create a private mirror of the repository.
- Make sure to make your repository public for your final submission.

## Submission Instructions
- Rename the submission notebook as "NUS_DSESC_DATABSTERS_\<TEAM NAME\>.ipynb". For example, if your team name is "TEAM1", your submission notebook should be named as "NUS_DSESC_DATABUSTERS_TEAM1.ipynb". \ You are allowed to modify the template in the submission notebook, but remember to ensure that your codes run. Your codes can be in either R / Python.
